# Overview

Case studies are smaller, self-contained applications that we use in class to explore R coding and regression. Included here are the following case studies: 

 * `NBA-data`: Basic applications of regression analysis using data on NBA player performance
 * `city-level-data`: Two code files exploring showing regression interpretation concepts (using logged values, handling variables measured as percentages, etc.)
