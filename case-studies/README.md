# ECON 490 Case Studies

This directory contains self-contained applications used in class to explore R coding and regression concepts. Each case study folder includes both the necessary data and R code files. Most R scripts will automatically download the required data from GitHub, so there's generally no need to download data files separately.

## Available Case Studies

### NBA Data
Simple regression examples using NBA player performance data. These scripts demonstrate:
- Basic regression concepts 
- Interpretation of coefficients
- Residual analysis
- Prediction functions

### City-Level Data
Two separate R files exploring various regression interpretation concepts:
- Interpreting coefficients for variables measured as percentages
- Log transformations and percentage interpretations
- Residualization 
- Omitted Variables Bias (OVB)

The city data includes fictional information on city output, tech industry employment share, and college graduation rates.

## How to Use These Case Studies

1. Open the desired `.R` file in RStudio
2. Run the code sequentially, following along with the comments
3. Experiment with the suggested exercises and questions

These case studies are designed to build on concepts introduced in lectures and coding activities. For best results, attempt the questions in the R files before checking the provided solutions. Each case study includes information on how to load the required data. In most cases, the data is automatically downloaded from GitHub within the R scripts.

## To-Do List

Case studies I would like to put together: 

 * `Spatial Data`: Two possibilities here including 1) plotting data over a standardized geography like counties in the US, or 2) plotting point data (to setup doing crime applications or something similar)
 * `Merging Data`: Showing a more "real-world" (i.e., messy) example of the kinds of data merging tasks research projects often require
