# Overview

Case studies are smaller, self-contained applications that we use in class to explore R coding and regression. Each case study folder includes both the data and the required `.R` code for that case study. In most cases, the `.R` file will automatically download the data from GitHub, so there's no need to separately download the data files. 

## Case Study Descriptions

 * `NBA-data`: Basic applications of regression analysis using data on NBA player performance
 * `city-level-data`: Two separate `.R` files exploring a range of useful regression interpretation concepts (including residualization, using logged values, handling variables measured as percentages, etc.)
