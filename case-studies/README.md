# Overview

Case studies are smaller, self-contained applications that we use in class to explore R coding and regression. Each case study folder includes both the data and the required `.R` code for that case study. In most cases, the `.R` file will automatically download the data from GitHub, so there's no need to separately download the data files. 

## Case Study Descriptions

 * `NBA-data`: Basic applications of regression analysis using data on NBA player performance
 * `city-level-data`: Two separate `.R` files exploring a range of useful regression interpretation concepts (including residualization, using logged values, handling variables measured as percentages, etc.)

## To-Do List

Case studies I would like to put together: 

 * `Spatial Data`: Two possibilities here including 1) plotting data over a standardized geography like counties in the US, or 2) plotting point data (to setup doing crime applications or something similar)
 * `Merging Data`: Showing a more "real-world" (i.e., messy) example of the kinds of data merging tasks research projects often require
